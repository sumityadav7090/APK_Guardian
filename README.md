# APK Analyzer Project

APK Guardian is a Flask-based web application designed to analyze Android Package (APK) files for malicious or fake banking application characteristics. It leverages static analysis, heuristic rules, and integration with external security services like VirusTotal to provide a comprehensive security report for uploaded APKs.

The primary goal is to help users and financial institutions identify potentially dangerous applications that mimic legitimate banking apps to steal credentials or sensitive information.

## Features

*   **Single APK Analysis:** Upload a single APK file for detailed security assessment.
*   **Batch Scan (Planned/Future):** Analyze multiple APKs simultaneously.
*   **Static Analysis:** Inspects APK components (permissions, manifest, code patterns) without execution.
*   **Heuristic Detection:** Applies a set of rules to identify suspicious behaviors and characteristics.
*   **VirusTotal Integration:** Queries VirusTotal for known threat intelligence on the APK's hash.
*   **Detailed Security Reports:** Generates comprehensive reports including:
    *   File Information (SHA-256, MD5, Size, Package Name, App Name)
    *   Overall Verdict and Risk Level
    *   Security Score Breakdown (Static, Dynamic, Privacy, Reputation)
    *   Threat Indicators (Malware Families, Behavioral Analysis)
    *   Permissions Analysis (with risk levels)
    *   Network Analysis (domains contacted)
    *   Recommendations for users
    *   External Scan Results (e.g., VirusTotal)
*   **Secure API Key Handling:** Uses a separate `config.py` file (ignored by Git) for sensitive API keys.
*   **Docker Support:** Easy deployment and environment setup using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Python (Flask)
*   **Machine Learning (Future/Placeholder):** `scikit-learn` (for potential AI-powered detection)
*   **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js (for data visualization)
*   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
  
## API Key Configuration (Crucial!)
## For the VirusTotal integration to work, you need to provide your API key. Do NOT commit your API key directly to GitHub!

## Obtain a VirusTotal API Key: If you don't have one, sign up on the VirusTotal website to get a free public API key.

## Create app/config.py: In the app/ directory, create a new file named config.py.

## Add your API Key: Open app/config.py and add the following line, replacing YOUR_ACTUAL_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY_HERE with your actual key:
